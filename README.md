*DESCRIPTION*
The Chat Application is a simple client-server-based messaging system that enables real-time communication between multiple users over a network. The server acts as a central hub, managing connections and broadcasting messages, while clients send and receive messages interactively. Built using Javaâ€™s ServerSocket and Socket classes, the project demonstrates socket programming, multi-threading, and I/O stream handling. The server listens for incoming connections and assigns each client a separate thread for smooth communication. This beginner-friendly project provides a strong foundation for understanding networking concepts and can be expanded with features like user authentication, private messaging, and GUI enhancements for a more advanced chat system.
